Step 1 - open terminal and type tsc --init (this creates a simple TS config file)
Step 2 - start ur project type npm init -y (creates node package.json)
Step 3 - mkdir src , mkdir dist 
            - src is where we write our code, common standard throughout all projects i.e whether react,angular,etc.
            - dist is the distribution which is something that goes into production which is being served to the end user.
Step 4 - create a index.ts file under src where we write out TS code and dist is where all our JS code goes.
Step 5 - go to tsconfig.json and uncomment the line "outDir" and add your path to dist folder.
Step 6 - now run the terminal with tsc -W 
            - it basically runs the Typescript code in Watch mode, so it keeps on running the things, and if there are 
              any changes in the TS it keeps on watching it.
Step 7 - go to index.html file and under the script tag add the path to the index.js file which is under the dist folder.
Step 8 - now running our project in live server in our localhost.
            - in terminal install these packages
            - npm i lite-server  OR, go to index.html file and right click and click on open with live server
Step 9 - now go to package.json file and replace the script with {"start":"lite-server"}.
Step 10 - now go to index.html file and right click and select stop live server.
        - now run "npm start" in your terminal, this will open our lite server.
Step 11 - now open another terminal and run "tsc -w" , this will run the TS project in watch mode.
